# About
Purpose of fuzzing is to automatically generate lots of test input and to make code crash and increase code coverage. [libFuzzer](http://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html) is a library for in-process, coverage-guided evolutionary fuzzing of other libraries. It is similiar to [American Fuzzy Lop (AFL)](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/) but performs fuzzing inside single process and is much faster.

# Motivation
There have been lots of vulnerabilities in popular libraries that should have been (theoretically) easy to test. We want to offer easy way to fuzz-test these libraries and increase awareness about the situation. We also want this to be available to everyone.

# About libfuzzer
* LibFuzzer is open-source library (part of LLVM)
* Relies on compiler instrumentation to get coverage feedback
* It is linked with the library under test
* Works fully inside the running program (a process) -> Fast!

LibFuzzer itself can be built with any compiler without specific flags. Target code must be buit with Clang using [ASan](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html), [USan](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html) or [MSan](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/MemorySanitizer.html) and -fsanitize-coverage=edge
Optional features are: 8bit-counters,trace-cmp,indirect-calls

# How does this project work?
* You pull container from Dockerhub
* Start Writing your own libfuzzer stub
* Share dockerfile with other users
* Use libFuzzer to collect corpus so that other people can continue where you left off

You can start writing stubs without docker.

# Getting started
* You can get started by reading our [Getting started tutorial](https://github.com/ouspg/libfuzzerfication/blob/master/GETTING-STARTED.md)
* See example: [mysamplelib](https://github.com/ouspg/libfuzzerfication/tree/master/stubs/mysamplelib)

# Material
* [libFuzzer](http://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html)
